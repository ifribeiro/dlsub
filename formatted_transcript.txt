the game is thousand to one you decide
who leaves with a thousand dollars
i think we should describe everyones
situation first very briefly because
we have one we could do it that way or
we could do like we have competitions
i feel like competitions isnt the best
i just dont want anybody to leave with
their feelings hurt or feeling like
my problems arent big enough theres
this trip to the bahamas
and i feel ashamed for talking about
what i will know youll feel you know
you dont know that though
in my current home im pretty much left
to fund myself
its like a lot of stress on me and its
like im sorry im getting emotional
its like im being forced to grow up so
fast and im only 16
theres this trip to the bahamas which
is very very expensive and the thousand
dollars would help me go to that
i feel like itd be super cool
experience is it like a trip through
your school or like no
you have a minute and ten okay we need
to vote okay this is
one vote for me another one for colleen
another one for me
and one for ej so theres a tie
just follow just vote
i know im gonna be out so why
because i dont know everyone has
something against me so
see this is what i didnt want to happen
if somebody gets hurt by whats
happening
youre
i feel like we should do something fun
you know something to bring up the mood
who can stand on one foot the line im
saying random stuff should we do that
one leg is standing up
first one falling out sure three two one
how do you feel do you think that was
fair during the no
